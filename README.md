# Flipkart_Backend
Integrated the backend to the existing Flipkart clone in 4 days with the team of 6 people. We have created our own API using the tech stacks Node JS, Express JS, MongoDB data base, and for the deployment of server we have used Heroku. Added Auth validation for adding products to cart, accessing the Wishlist, and for Checkout by generating a token during signup and login using JWT package.
